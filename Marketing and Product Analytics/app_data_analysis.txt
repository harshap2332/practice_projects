-- ■	Marketing Analytics:
-- ●	Analyse marketing campaign performance by channel (spend, conversions, and conversion rate).
SELECT channel, SUM(spend) AS total_spend,
SUM(conversions) AS total_conversions,
(SUM(conversions) / SUM(clicks)) * 100 AS conversion_rate 
FROM `appdataanalysis`.`app_data`.`marketing_events` 
GROUP BY channel;

-- ●	Calculate the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) for each campaign.
SELECT marketing_events.campaign_id, 
marketing_events.spend / marketing_events.conversions AS cpa 
FROM `appdataanalysis`.`app_data`.`marketing_events` AS marketing_events;

-- ●	Identify which channels are most cost-effective in terms of conversions.
SELECT channel, SUM(conversions) / SUM(spend) AS conversion_rate
FROM `appanalysis-447013`.`app_data`.`marketing_events`
WHERE spend > 0
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC;


--■	Product Analytics:

-- ●	Analyse feature adoption rates (how many users engaged with specific features).
SELECT feature_name, 
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS adoption_rate 
FROM `appdataanalysis`.`app_data`.`app_events` 
GROUP BY feature_name;

-- ●	Calculate daily or weekly active users (DAU/WAU).
SELECT event_date,
 COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_active_users 
 FROM `appdataanalysis`.`app_data`.`app_events` 
 GROUP BY event_date;

-- ●	Perform cohort analysis to track user retention over time.

LEFT JOIN `appdataanalysis`.`app_data`.`app_events` AS app_events

GROUP BY cohort, event_date;

-- ●	Analyse average session duration per feature and user location.
SELECT app_events.feature_name, user_data.location,
